# Intro

Package Picker is a recommendation platform for JavaScript, Java and Python packages. It uses machine learning to predict packages that are frequently used with the packages in your projects. Check it out at [pkgpkr.com](http://pkgpkr.com), or our [documentation site](https://pkgpkr.github.io/Package-Picker/).
