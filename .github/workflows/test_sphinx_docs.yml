        # The folder containing your sphinx docs.
        docs-folder: docs/
        # The command used to build your documentation.
        build-command: make html
        # Run before the build command, you can use this to install system level dependencies, for example with "apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y perl"
        pre-build-command: apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y gcc
